## Beta Release: The Event Horizon

Welcome to our beta release.

Our initial focus is on mastering the city's dynamic event landscape. We fetch, filter, and enhance event data from multiple platforms to bring you a unified, comprehensive view of hyperlocal events. Whether it's a tech meetup in Koramangala, a concert in Indiranagar, or a workshop in Jayanagar—if it's happening, it's on **BangaloreNow.live**.

This is just the first step.

## Our Foundation & Gratitude

This initiative stands on the shoulders of giants. Our pipeline is built upon and enhanced from the foundational work of **@captn3m0** from **blr-today**. We extend our immense gratitude for their open-source `events.db` dataset, which you can explore at [github.com/blr-today/dataset](https://github.com/blr-today/dataset).

## The Engine: Automated & Scalable

Our entire data pipeline is a sophisticated, fully-automated system deployed on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. It runs relentlessly, ensuring the information you receive is always current, accurate, and relevant. This is enterprise-grade infrastructure for a city-scale mission.

## The Vision: Beyond Events

We are just getting started. Our ambition is to exponentially expand this platform to cover every facet of urban life in Bangalore. Our near-future roadmap includes:

-   **Civic Intelligence:** Ingesting and tracking BBMP tenders to bring transparency to public works.
-   **Urban Alerts:** Monitoring and reporting on civic issues like water shortages, power cuts, and other essential service disruptions.
-   **Personalized Dashboards:** Building a user-centric experience where you can customize the information that matters most to you.

We are on a trajectory to become the indispensable tool for every resident of Bangalore.

## Join the Revolution

This is more than a project; it is an initiative to build a more connected, transparent, and accessible city. We are actively looking to open-source our work and invite passionate individuals to help us build the future.

If you are a developer, a data scientist, a designer, or simply someone who believes in this vision, we want to hear from you.
